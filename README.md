## Mechanics 🔩

![Gameplay](https://i.ibb.co/7dJJ0bzm/orig.gif)

The main mechanics of the game are related to _removing bolts from molds_. You need to assemble the bolts of the right colors to link the picture. 

When you take out the bolt, its thread gets on the spool, when it is filled, it will automatically start knitting the picture. If the color does not match any reel, the thread ends up in the trash, if the trash is overflowing, you lose.

Shapes - Hinje Joints, when you take out the bolt, the shape starts to move, so you need to think through a strategy to get everything you need.

You can use __superpowers__ to gain an advantage in some game situations!
